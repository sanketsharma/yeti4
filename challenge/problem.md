Announcement:
> YETI Challenge Lives On – Deadline 1/31

> Calling all students! This year’s YETI (Year End Technical Intrusion, or whatever it’s called) challenge is on! This is the fourth year in a row for this series of technical puzzles and tasks involving elements of programming, problem solving, and creativity.

>On an night of observing the sky, Dr. Lindsay received a mysterious transmission that seemed like it might contain this year’s YETI challenge, but when he sent it over we couldn’t figure out how to open it! He thought it was going to be five images containing information about the task, but we only received a single JPEG file (see below) that doesn’t open. He said the transmission seemed to come in a stream of 16-bit chunks, and we know that JPEGs bytestreams often start with a header FF D8 FF E0, but I don’t see that in the file either. Try to figure out what’s in the messages so we can actually do YETI this year...

> If you get to the challenge and complete it, let us know how you did each step. Send a github link to** **[llee@utk.edu](mailto:llee@utk.edu)****,** **[tholmes@utk.edu](mailto:tholmes@utk.edu)****, and** **[slindsay@utk.edu](mailto:slindsay@utk.edu)** **by 11:59pm on January 31, 2025.**

> As always, YETI is voluntary and is all about the glory (and some cash). All finishers will receive frankly adorable tiny YETIs. If you’re on an RA, make sure to discuss with your supervisor before diving in.

> For questions and general communication, we’ll use the newly created department Mattermost (slack alternative).
