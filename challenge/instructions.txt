1. start_of_image.sh finds the markers of JPEG start of image
2. split.sh splits the data into four data files
3. fix_endianness.sh fixes the endianness of two byte chunks in which the data was recieved
4. The fourth file image looks somewhat similar to one of the other images but it looks suspeciously large in size. Since we were expecting five jpegs, we look for a hidden file.
5. find_hidden.sh finds the hidden image offset
6. extract_hidden_file.sh splits the fourth jpeg file into two images
